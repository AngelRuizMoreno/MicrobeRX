## Description

**MicrobeRX is A tool for enzymatic reaction-based metabolite prediction in the gut microbiome.** <br><br>

> The main publication and details about the tool can be found in this publication:

>> [publication here]()

> The python library was developed to be integrated easily with any other bioinformatic or cheminformatic tool.

> This repository contains examples as Jupyter Notbooks showing the capabilities of this library.
